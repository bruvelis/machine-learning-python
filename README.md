## Setup Python 3.6 virtual environment (venv)
As Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 does not ship with Python 3.6 use bootstrapping script 
[tools/python-venv-setup.sh](tools/python-venv-setup.sh) to download and install latest 
Python 3.6 using Miniconda and setup venv with Python libraries:
```bash
jupyter pandas keras sklearn seaborn tensorflow
```
